## Further Down the line
* We will integrate a ML based face recognition feature which will make it easier to take attendance. 

* A weekly Tasks section will be added where a student can upload his or her assignments so that teachers don't have to rely on external softwares like Google classroom. 

* An announcement section where students as well as teachers will be able to post announcements.
